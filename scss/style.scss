// this file imports all our csss prtials to be compiled in one stylesheet, which you can attach to your html.

// all the tiles that are prefixed with an underscore "_name-of-file.scss" are called partials — 
// meaning that their css isn't compiled unless it's imported into an unprefized .scss file.

// import variables, mixins, and other modules (usually compass related)
@import "base"; 
@import "mixins"; 

// import component rules
@import "components/main";
